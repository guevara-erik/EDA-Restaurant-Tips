# Restaurant Tip Performance - Exploratory Data Analysis

**Problem to solve:** Who is the group that gives a more generous tip? what are the hidden patterns in this restaurant dataset? What is the relationship between the gender, the group size, day of the week, if the customer is a smoker or not, or if the service is for lunch or dinner in relationship with the tip given by the customer?

Data Information:

- Total Bill, total amount to pay
- Tip, tip provided after the service
- Sex, gender of the person who pays (assumption)
- Smoker, the customer goes to the allowed smoking section or not
- Day, the restaurant opens from Thursday to Sunday
- Time, the restaurant serves lunch and dinner
- Size, group size
