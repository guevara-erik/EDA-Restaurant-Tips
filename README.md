# EDA-Restaurant-Tips
Problem to solve: Who is the group that gives a more generous tip? what are the hidden patterns in this restaurant dataset? What is the relationship between the gender, the group size, day of the week, if the customer is a smoker or not, or if the service is for lunch or dinner in relationship with the tip given by the customer?
